What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was asked to solve for these projects was analyze data structures and how well each will apply to the problem present by ABC University. They presented the need for a software to help its computer science advisors access course information for students, loading data from a csv file, requiring featured to print alphanumerically and search a specific course details. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach to solving this problem was to first outline the functions and methods needed in psuedocode to accomplish the task at hand in the 3 main data structures we analyzed over the course, vectors, binary search tables(BST), and hash tables. After outlining the pseudocode for functionality I then analyzed both the runtime and memory of a software that would use each of these data types to determine which to use in the final code. My results lead me to prefer the hash table for this specific software functionality and finished out my final code using the outline I created for said hash table. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
