What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was asked to solve for these projects involved analyzing data structures and determining how well each would apply to a problem presented by ABC University. The university required software to help its computer science advisors access course information for students. This included loading data from a CSV file and implementing features to print courses alphanumerically and search for specific course details as well.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

My approach began with outlining the necessary functions and methods in pseudocode to achieve the required functionality using the three main data structures we studied throughout the course: vectors, binary search trees (BST), and hash tables. After writing the pseudocode, I analyzed the runtime efficiency and memory usage of a solution built with each structure. This analysis led me to select the hash table as the most efficient and appropriate data structure for the given problem. I then implemented the final code based on the pseudocode I had created for the hash table.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

As with other projects I’ve worked on, I approached challenges not just as obstacles but as learning opportunities. Inevitably, I encountered compiler errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior in my code. However, over the past few years of working on coding assignments and school projects, I’ve learned to stay calm and persistent in the face of these issues. I now enjoy the process of troubleshooting using outside resources such as textbooks, articles, and videos. The field of software engineering is constantly evolving with technological advancements, and I’ve come to understand that the learning never really stops—even after earning a degree and starting a job. Every problem I encounter adds to my growth as a developer.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This course has deepened my understanding of data storage, handling, and organization. We explored multiple data structures and learned how each performs under different conditions in terms of runtime and memory usage. It also improved my ability to analyze the trade-offs between these structures based on the functions involved. As a result, I now feel more confident in choosing the appropriate data structure for a given problem—an essential skill as I continue in my computer science courses and eventually begin my career in software engineering.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

One major improvement in my programming practice has been the use of modular functions and methods. I focused on breaking down larger, more complex functions into smaller, reusable components. This made my code easier to read and understand for others who might work with it later and also allowed me to reuse those components in other parts of the program when appropriate. Writing modular code not only enhances readability but also improves maintainability and adaptability for future development.
